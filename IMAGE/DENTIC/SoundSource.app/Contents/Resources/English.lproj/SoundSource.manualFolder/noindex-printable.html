			<h1 align="center">SoundSource: A Superior Sound Control</h1>
			<p>SoundSource is a handy tool for MacOS designed to give you fast access to all your critical audio settings. From SoundSource's menu bar icon, you can adjust your Input, Output and Sound Effects devices and volume settings in mere moments. SoundSource's Play-Thru window also enables the soft play-thru of audio from input devices, enabling you to hear audio coming in through a microphone or any other audio device.</p>
			

			<h3>Getting Started</h3>

				<li><p>Enhancement: SoundSource will run in the Dock and the menu bar by default. Switch to menu bar only mode right from the Preferences window.</p></li>	
			
				<li><p>Enhancement: Make sure SoundSource is always available with the &ldquo;Start SoundSource at login &rdquo; preference.</p></li>				
				
				<li><p>Other: SoundSource now requires Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)</p></li>	
		</ul>

    	<h1>SoundSource's Global Menu</h1>
      	
        <p>SoundSources's global menu will provide access to its settings from any application. You'll find the icon for the global SoundSource menu in the upper right of your screen:</p>
        
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/globalmenu-icon.png" width="540" alt="SoundSource's global menu icon">
			<br>SoundSource's Global Menu Bar Icon
		</p>
   	    
		<p>No matter what application you're currently using, clicking this icon gives you access to SoundSource's functions.</p>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/globalmenu-menu.png" width="540" alt="">
			<br>SoundSource's Global Menu in Action
		</p>
		
		<p>As you can see, the menu shows SoundSource's options, and allows you to open the <a href="playthru.html">Play-Thru window</a> as well.</p>	


      	<h3>Menu Bar-Only Mode</h3>
      	
		<p class="centeredimage">

			<br>SoundSource's Display Setting
		</p>

		<p>If you like, SoundSource can run exclusively in your menu bar, with no icon in the Dock or application switcher. To adjust how SoundSource displays, open the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a> and change the &ldquo;Show SoundSource&rdquo; setting.</p>

    	<h1>SoundSource's Play-Thru Window</h1>

		<p>To access SoundSource's Play-Thru window, select &ldquo;Open Play-Thru Window&rdquo; from the global SoundSource menu. This window allows you to select an Input device from which to pull audio and an Output device through which that audio will be heard. You can also adjust the channels used for each device.</p>
      
		<p align="center"><img src="images/playthru-screenshot.png" style="width: 540px; height: 410px;" alt="Play-Thru Window"></p>

		<p>To hear audio from a specific input device, select it in the Input area. Next, set the Output device, then click the &ldquo;Start Play-Thru&rdquo; button. Any audio picked up by the input device will now be heard via the output. That's it!</p>

		<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to avoid feedback loops, by isolating the output from the input. You can do this by sending a microphone's audio to headphones, so that the audio doesn't leak back to the microphone.</p>
