	    	<h1>Purchasing SoundSource</h1>
        
	        <p><b>Quick Link</b>: To buy a license key for SoundSource, visit our <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/store">online store</a>.</p>

			<h3>Why should I buy SoundSource?</h3>
			<p>Put simply, you should buy SoundSource because it isn't free. We provide a free trial, so you can test out the program and all its features before you buy it. It's like test driving a car, for as long as it takes you to decide.</p> 

			<p>During the trial, all of SoundSource's features are available to try, but it won't work for full-time use. While in trial mode, SoundSource's features will disable 10 minutes after the app is launched.</p>
		
			<p>If you use SoundSource and find you like it, please purchase a license key - support the software you use and love!</p>

			<p>To purchase your license key, just visit <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/store/">https://rogueamoeba.com/store/</a>.</p>

			<h2>After Purchase</h2>

		<h3>How do I unlock the full version?</h3>
		<p>The download of SoundSource from our site contains both a free trial of the software and the full version. To unlock the full, unlimited version, you just need a valid license key. When you purchase through our store, you'll immediately receive a license key in your browser as well as via email. Simply enter this key into SoundSource to unlock it.</p>

		<h3>What's your upgrade policy?</h3>
		<p>While we don't have a hard and fast upgrade policy, our philosophy regarding paid upgrades is simple: We try to do what's right for you and what's right for us. We've got a great track record, with many years of very satisfied customers.</p>
		
		<p>For more details on free updates and paid upgrades, please see <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=MiscUpgradePolicy">this page</a>.</p>

		<h3>What's your refund policy?</h3>
		<p>All Rogue Amoeba products are available to try before you buy. We believe that no customer should have to buy software in order to find out how well it works. Our software can be fully evaluated with no limitations in capabilities, prior to purchase. Customers are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to take advantage of these trials prior to purchase. You may also seek any needed technical support from us - we answer support emails rapidly and responsively for current and potential customers alike.</p>

			<p>If you would like a refund, please contact <a href="mailto: hello@rogueamoeba.com">hello@rogueamoeba.com</a> within 14 days of your purchase. Because we cannot recover the license key that was sold, refunds are issued on a case-by-case basis.</p>
